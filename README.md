# Northcoder News

The main solo-sprint project of the Northcoders bootcamp, this **React based** front-end uses the API built in the back-end sprint to create a mock news website, where users can read and comment on stories.

Over the course of the project we initially planned out the pages and structure in **Figma**, before creating the app in React with CSS styling.

Since the end of the course I have returned to this project to refactor the code in several ways: 

- Switching from class/functional Components to using **Hooks**/Functional Components
- Resolving errors left from the inital sprint and expanding functionality
- Creating a mock login to explore the use of Context in React
- Improving the original styling through exploring the use of **Styled Components** for a more cohesive and responsive design


## Running the application

Clone the project to your local machine, once opened in the IDE, you can run

### `npm start`

which will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

From here you can view the site as a 'guest' or use the suggested login user on the homepage to enable commenting.
